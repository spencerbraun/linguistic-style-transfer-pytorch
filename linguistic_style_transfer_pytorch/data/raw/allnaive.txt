if you said no i can tell you how.
all of these things are a huge benefit in laer life.
it's a fact that when people spend more time together, they have more fun.

mother earth has given us many gifts.

i believe having a limit each day on your computer might help solve these problems.
typing helps you if you want to become a secretary or even a newspaper editor.
its the parents fault if their child gets ahold of a book that has adult content on or in it.
she could have handle the sitiutation herself, by just comforting the person about it.
also if someone doesn't know where a house or store is located they cab quickly look it up on the computer.
often, peolple get cranky while they are using a computer or if they need to get off of one.
another reason computer time is a good time could be is it saves money on other things.
let alone read about it in school!
lastly, having computer skills is very, very, very important in the real world.
you can search any topic and learn more about it.
if you will please continue on i would like to share with you my thoughts.
censorship causes blidness.
people think they are private, but everything that is uploaded or posted is public.
without computers, people would be incredibly stressed, and have a hard time making life easier.
if you go on the internet you can find many pictures of any thing you want.
if we keep improving technology you will be able to do alot more than you can do now.
if people use computers more often they'll probably develop the skills to pursue job opportunities on a much wider market.
it does alot for us.
spending time with family.
people should be going about to have fun get sunlight not staying at the computer all the time.
i was typing like a pro.
of kids say that they are happier when they have something fun to look forward to, and happier kids do better work.
they have to fill out an alpaction out online when kids get older they want to look up schools they want to go to.
he used to weigh over pounds.
they are also used for several different things like downloading music on your .
they should at least go out for a walk instead of using all their electrity.
isnt being outside on a beautiful day great?
she enjoyed a certain website on the internet.
if we do that, then all the books would be off the shelf.
as, you can see a computer is so helpful and is a great resource.
they also help things go faster.
it is all over the internet and you can't control that.
nobody just sits home and does nothing those days.
is that the world we want for kids?
computers are used everywhere, for thousands of different things.
there are thousands of fun games online that can help improve your reflexes and eyesight.
i used my computer not only did i get my information quickly.
people who work at about need the computer to access your account to get your money.
do the members of this well-known and captivating newspaper think that the effects of people owning a computer are good or bad?
next, even the music today placed in libraries is not good clean music.
people you actually really need talk to, such as friends, teachers or even people you never talk to in school.
for example they show things about mythology for making a pat.
that can be scary because you do not know if this person is really someone you thought they were.
i think that computers have a bad effect on people.
i mean there's where people can socialize with their families who live out of state.
all you need to do is type in vacation spots and click enter.
authors are brilliant people.
if a person want's to be lazy, then that's their decision.
i would create a good atmosphere in the school.
i say lets put a ge limit on them and mack our socity beeter and are kids to become beter adoults later on in ther life.
also you can chat on or .
computers are so much easier to use than books.
i hope you agree with me!
so now i hope you agree with my opinion and support the use of computer's.
finally, people should stop using computers as much as they are now, in order to keep their safety safe.
for example, what if an athiest wrote a book saying that wasn't real?
how does she feel about it?
computers would be easier for you to collect research than a book.
these are the question you need to ask yourself about certain materials that appear in libraries.
but those books will be in libraries forever and you can't make them go away because you don't want you're chilren to read them.
at last but not least people will stop going outside and not go and walk or talk, with friends.
last week, he took me with him to the forest.
people use computers for work.
dear newspaper, i think people need computers.
please think about what i have said and thank you for taking your time out of your day to read this
computes help us by giving information about things in othe contries, states, and towns.
i believe that there should be a very limited selection that children can see.
almost everything you can get stuff out of store because they have online store to mail to you.
you can even watch fights you want.
you will always miss out on fun activities, then when people start talking about how much fun they had you're going to wish you were there.
in conclusion, i don't think censorship should be put on materials in libraries due to the fact that many information could be lost.
in fact, about of computer say that over a using a computer.
consequently, the reason has made families start to cut many useful technologe devices out of the.
camp out on the weekend place to become closer with your family and friends.
i do believe computers have a positive effect on people.
and are many ways to chat with people like over the phone on a cell phone.
he takes the help of p. t. teachers too.
so if the parent buys the child that that is bad it is the parents fault.
i felt like i couldnt talk to my parents about these things.
computers have benifited society in so many ways.
if they do not want to buy it then they should simply move on to another shelf or to a completely different store.
schools have websites for students to go to findout there homework, classwork, projects, reports, and extracredit.
but should those materials be removed from the library?
are offensive and are bad that they should be removed, the reason being is because of younger children.
you can talk to relatives in far away places but to travel with this.
you also can play games on facebook, myspace or any thing els.
of course, we all have friends in different cities and/or states!
as it destroys the rants almost all the housewives love the cat.
ok there is one thing that can be taken off the shevels is the magazines.
to editor, 's a beautiful day.
the magazine was offensive to wonmen.
in the state of , about of people have a laptop or a computer in their home.
now is the time to get on your feet and find something else to do!
as you can see, those are just a few reasons i think that computers have a positive affect on us.
killing the layer the are much more powerful, hurting people.
students should spend more time with their families, they should exercise more, and lastly focus more on their grades in school.
some people were talking.
so i think that we should try to combine what people like to do on computers, with what they should be doing more often, like exercising.
finally, you can find pleasure in computers.
on the computers are very helpfull.
people never talk to eachother face to face anymore.
by games, i observe how into since i started seeing as role model to me, high making a stride for a .o .
therefore, i invite you to join me to demonstrate the icrredible strenght of computers.
i thought it didn't feel very fair at all, it's selfish and inconsiderate.
they also allow us to communicate with people who we are not able to see very often.
that's why it is important for people to find out news quickly so that they can help.
i have people who stay up for our their paper.
dear the , i belive that computers offer a lot more pros than they do cons.
you can do alot of stuff on the internet that costs too much to do without it.
instead, i believe the item should not be removed and stay on the shelves.
all right, so, computers are one of the most important tools, of this world that we live in today.
teenagers spend too much time on the going where they should instead of doing more benefitul activities like reading.
it helps us build hand-eye coordination.
because it shortens activity time.
i believe that computers are very useful tools for learning and communication, but people today over use that power.
this makes travel to and from school much easier.
i choose to do it on the computer it came out nice and neat with picturs.
and that is the only way you will win is by using teamwork.
someone who has been a write their whole lives checks out the question, and answers ion great detail.
not interacting with anyone causes their social skills to weaken since they are always on the computer.
that is why i think that you can work on the computer.
computers help society do various activities that would be impossible if we didn't have computers.
books have been an important tool for students for a long time.
for example, a study at showed that families with more computers in their houses communicated less.
doing that with their life.
i feel that technology can be both good and bad.
then i started to use the computer more and my coordination improved.
erasing things from lives,have done no good before.
inappropriate media is surrounding us daily, including children.
some people prefer to have penpals.
when i went to the libraren and asked for a series of books, and was always turned down, because of the christin population.
if you do not like certain magazines that they have then order magazines online.
finally, more & more people are becomeing unhealthy.
they their friends how to type in the computer and teach them some stuff about the history.
we are the and parents.
a computer can also teach you hand-eye cordination.
not the best idea i say, people in the have actsets to a .
either to do home work or play games.
if you have a e-mail teachers and people at work might have to e-mail each other to handle business.
kids will spend time texting on their cellphones when they're not in the mood for calling.
many people in society think computers are bad, i think computers are exellent.
the internet is where you can resurch anything and tones of helpful ideas come up.
sometimes they arn't even talking to who they believed they were, it not only dangerous but unhealthy also.
first off, computers teach hand-eye coordination.
they might be playing on educational game on the computers.
everyone has some friends.
is not the only person in which he is transfered far away from home.
consequently, certain people use computer because the help you with certain things.
instead of picking up a book you can go online.
people are also in busy with there computers that they spend less and less time enjoying nature.
those are my details to support my reason.
in conclusion, i don't think books, music, movies, magazines, etc.
next is that it's a great current learning resource.
we know them well.
now, we have one small device that we carry around with us to do our work.
hand-eye coordination is used from day to day everyday.
another is that people of all ages are becoming brainwashed by this electronic and not spending the time to learn things in quality.
people come home by .k and other fast food go on the computer and eat.
this isn't a problem though because people have to spend long periods of time on computers in order to do the beneficial things that computers have to offer.
there are many bad things that result from computers.
they work long hard hours getting a book ready to be published and then someone wants to take it off the shelf becasue it offened a few people?
watch or not on a .
but, you can't talk on the phone due to long-distance calls; so with a computer people don't have to lose touch!
thanks to computers, i have that opportunity.
now a days, material that is offensive to some is all around.
also you like to use cellphone alot the waves kill apoximately bees a year.
you might argue with your family a lot and don't you want to have a healthy relationship.
i don't take any type of material that i'm looking at in any negative way because i know that someone else's opinion and not my own.
there is no doubt that electronics, play a huge role in this event.
dear local newspaper editor, you love haveing the enternet at your finger tips.
the show you how to get to a certain destination.
i think not.

if you're in school and you need to research, well there you go, you have a computer to help you.
online you can learn about the history of specific places.

your town holds activites or has a fun place you could too.
computers also help with instructions on how to make things.
you could talk to a family or a friend if you or they don't have a phone.
my third reason is finding out things.
is a good way for kids to talk to one another because some might not have phones or you don't see them at all during the school day.
they have just started to be able to use the computers, so many times they go through a phase or addiction.
therefore in the end books should be censored!
when an author writes a childrens book, it is meant for a child to read, not an adult.
( was remaried to bonnie and now carrys a scars on his belly).
last but not least, computers just simply make life easier by helping you with everday needs.

computers are great for us and good for bussy people.
said that of people that get a new computer spend minutes more than what time they usually spend on it.
people type their work up or they send work to their e-mail to bring home.
i agree with katherine paterson.
i would say this because there are different help programs or websites that help people in everyday life.

in these we learn better how the world works around us and with this we learn things that can be dangerous.
people all over the world have different interests in differtent subjects.
you find out more of what is in your maryard then you already knew.
family, friend and coligees are all people you need to talk to.
could you imagine the amount of people that would be sick if everyone used the computer for the majority at their day?
exercising, a very important thing for a healthy body and mind have a hard enough time finding time to do this.
do you want to carry around that heavy of a burden with you until your death?
in a time crunch situation like college or high school, speed is everything.
some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computer and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends.
they create divertion that make concentrating hard.
so these are my reasons for agreeing that certain materialsm such as books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from the shelves if found offensive.
i guest i also agree with using computers because they give you skills they going to places don't give you.
many people say its like staring into a flashlight for an extended amount of time.
the sex, drugs, and violence used to create a story, have destroyed the minds of our youth.
when im not in school i try to stay away from everything that reminds me of it, like libraries.
most children are addicted to computer games.
inside the forest, there was very little sunlight.
computers are a part of most peoples everydaylives, and essential to most bussiness.but the common question in our society is, are computers really benefitting us?
if all libraries were censored it could potentially lead to several complications with workers, students, or people who are just looking for a good book to read
computers are very helpful to us and improves everything about the way we live.
so, say you stumbled across a book about the in the library and you are a person from negro descent.
in conclusion computers should be taken seriosly because they do help society.
in which the library would be harrassed for not letting the child check it out.
the addictive games and electronic features lead you to believe that the people or you see are real life situations and activities.
censorship was created to protect people from things that they feel to be wrong.
some people prefer to write than type but other people prefer to type than write.
statics show that people would rather spend more time on the computer talking to people or listening to music than spend time with there own children or parents.
they would pick the computer over someone who has been in their life forever.
however, it has grown so much.
a good example of this is the popular internet video site, .
there are many fun and games that help you to be a better and healthier person while still having fun.
the computer in my thought helps you learn about new technology stuff such as new games to help you learn or new websites.
""'s fun and gets my son prepared!""
i read or the local newspaper that lots of people use computers and that not everyone agrees that this benefits society.
i think that at least of people would try this.
this is another nacessity for basic needs!!!!
games are very adicting.
espaecially if the movie is promoting sex, violence, and other things that young kids should not be doing.
lastly, you are able to talk to people from faraway, i think computers are a positive thing.
we require water for different purposes.
if one person does not find the content of a book attractive then simply do not read the book.
some people are almost addicted to their .
secondly people need to start enjoying nature insteed of being on the computer at the time.
from my own past experiences on this situation i know how wrong it is to take away someone's own privelage to enjoy types of literature.
a computer has information about anyone you chance.
i strongly urge you to look at any point of view closely.
as i said before computers can be benifical to .
he grows food crops.
if there is a book that is so bad you wouldnt want your kids reading, why would it of been published?
talking to in country is unbelievable.
int he library there are many magazines that are meant for adult eyes only.
also shows things about your personal info.
then your going to pay for that as well.
they help pay taxes.
do you remember the last time your mom or dad went on a business trip and you couldn't talk to the because they were busy?
little do parents know, it is a very uncensored world and at anytime a child can learn of it's exsistance.
so for now, i stand by the opinion that computers are great, and extremely useful to everyone.
we should have milk every day.
where would a school store all their grades and tardys?
what is your choice in these actions.
thats a harmful work it is.

by going on the computer, i learned all i needed to know and they some.
another thing you can do is download music to your do you ever have line that think of not busy so do it now.
as you can tell i'm a huge music fan and there has been lots of songs that were offensive but it did not bug me much.
everyone is intitled to their own opinion.
you know when you find a book on the shelf and discover that the content in the book are not word that are oppropity for children to read.
people can use , , and etc.
my next reason why spending time on the computer too much is bad is because you wont have time for your friends or family.
how much easier could it get?
milk is not only important for growing children but also for people of all age groups.
now if you organize your thoughts on the computer, and are able to look through them again at why a huge alleviated.

another problem people encounter with the internet is being too focused.
whether it is a magazine, movie etc everyone in the world is going to see it some way or another.
what do you do?

at the same time other people say that we should not remove it from the book shelves.

if you need information, talk to someone, or buy something its got it.

believe it or not, having to type a paper for school helps out alot in hand-eye coordination.
if people followed what the box says and listen to the guidlines, then there would be no problem.
for example, movies have ratings for different age groups, and books could do the same.

in my opinion, it depends on what they are saying or what they are showing.
even his meaningless chatter is a source of joy.
the internet lets you explore new things and help find ideas.
it would be wrong to strip the kids of any learning tools.
the school has even started doing something very new, allowing parents and kids to check the students grade online.
well if you let me just sum it up for you.
the media does a bad job of showing teens it not right to do the things they see on tv.
i feel this way because it can warn us about a natural disaster.
people are mixed in to these machines they become anti-social, don't do homework, potentially fail the unit and reappeat the grade.
so it's rely important to have hand-eye.
a library is a public place for anybody to go check out anything they want.
for one your eyes will begin to hurt.
in conclusion, i must say once again that i support the advances of technology to an extent.
thank you for taking your time to read my opinion, and i hope i helped
without them, we would be and have nothing
the reason is that, you can interact with others online.
dear , i think that computers affect our country in a positive way.
have such a good lifestyle for them, do you want to feel guilty for ruining that?
so with the information, made of wide variety of brouchers from it.
school libraries are made to help assist the students' academic acheivement, nothing more and nothing less.
they make people antisocial, unhealthy, and do bad things.
for example, kids with cancer, or even need to check them can let you talk to this kinds in.
but the public library has alot of different things and than a school library.
if a child finds something that their parents can be taken as offensive, then the library could possibly get sued and that would not be good.

in the hands of man.
there should be a certain age when a child reads or see's certain things.
if your looking up how to tie a tie or even info about your history report the is a sure easy thing.
also, you can't escape explicit material.
so, in the end people should know that computers are not benefiticial.
seond, they can help save the environment.
although there are many new methods of communication nowadays, the post office is still very important.
don't you want your children to grow up with great hand-eye coordinatio?

some people overuse their authority by being loud in the libraries preventing others from reading or during something to occpy themselves.
thats why i said don't let youre life pass by you.
another reason why in libraries certain materials shouldn't be removed is that by removing certain materials you would be interfering with education.
secondly, if children have a computer at home their parents should be limiting the time and what exactly they could do on the computer.
i would not have gotten that grade if i did not use the computer to do research.

most likely not all of that is due to the use of computers, but i bet a great deal of it is.
should take him off the shelf because jews think it was offensive, yeah it might be but it lets people know about our history and what has happened.
most kids spend most of their time on the computer or on or .
finaly computers save lives, its completly true.
the lack of exercising causes obeseity, and cardovascular problems.
i must admit, i am not an avid reader on my own.
most use this account to talk to their friends online.
you can get addicted to a game or something like facebook/ and be on there all the time.
to keep the viewers entertained.
it's really that neccesary.
although computers are hurting them by, the screen being too bright and hurting your eyes.
and they still do.
there has been lots of talk and arguments about computers and wether they benefits the society.
as the world evolves, so does the human race's morals and there is nothing that is offensive to all the people in the world.
i think that computers are only making our soceity a smarter and more inteligent place.
for example, when babies learn how to walk the religh on their brains show them how it's done.
i mean they talk about how to give pleasureable sex.
computer are helpful when your car is broken down or when you have no car.
censorship, thats a word that causes alot of arguements in today's society.
is an indecator that a person who could find foul language offensive, that such person should no buy that song.
i think this messing people up.
they believe that these generations are relying too much on computers and not spending enough time exercising outside or socializing.
it is a persons own right to see certain things that are offensive if they choose to do so.
they can give us wonderful facts and news that would otherwise be hard to obtain.
it can perminatly damage them.
second of all, is that computers give people the ability to learn about far away places.
my first reason why i think computers are bad for our society is people are spending to much time on them.
before instruments, music was just purely voice, but as the centuries went on, music became more advanced.
but the most that i think thats the best in my opinion is going to school online.
if you participate in these activities, you will meet other kids your age around the town.
this would be a big problem for everybody involved.
when people go on the computer ther are not on for hours straight.
many girls have gotten taken because of this.
the computers are children from a better education.
it has changed the way we do almost everything today.
everyone is different and unique in the world and they have their own unique opinions.
for example if you had to type something up you would of have to used a type writer and those things are hard to use.
that, and textbooks often use up a lot of desk space, but all you nneed is the space that a computer will consume anyway.
so keep reading and think what you hear that could or has happened to you.
computer have a positive effect of people and they can help people learn new things, like, places, people, and news in the world.
this is right if the community strongly agrees with their local libraries.
this can not only make the public upset, but can possibly lead to the author getting fired.

my first reason is computer teach you hand eye coordination.
for example, you have just bought a new house and want to know more about that area.
i believe this because every year new and exciting and websites are created and make life easier.
in conclusion, computer are really benefitting society.
so who gets their way in this little arguement?
as you now know computers help not only humans but the eviorments this is because they are ecofriendly, efficient, and loaded with information.
secretly left his house and went because he was curious.
i was at a library one time and there way these to guys.
like for example this gas station near my house is getting re-built because something went wrong with the pipes this is costing us all about .
many programs let you to people through the internet.
it can come from the parents, their friends, teachers anybody.
for example, when you have an essay to right about .
and i know that some people find rap music offensive and some doesnt.
it puts not very good thoughts in some peoples heads.
, in my opinion computers can be entertaining and educational, but should not replace everyday living.
after time the starts to become worse and worse and the kids gain weight and keep gaining wait then become obese and unhealthy.
also search engines provide acess to thousands of information loaded pages.
from what i seen in my life about censorship is that they should not take stuff off of the shelf just because of its content.
you could learn which college is right for you without leaving your house.
just like religion shouldn't be taught in public schools, censoring shouldn't be allowed in public libraries.
i strongly believe that people have a bad affection people because you addicted, you spend less time with your family and friends.
second, the allows you to learn about new places and things all around the world.
when they go to work, not everything will be done on a computer, but this is all they are being taught to use.
if you don't get out and play or exercise, you will become tired.
i think u should never stay on a computer for no more than a hour.
with having the use of computers many people don't properly know how to use and find information in books.
it's not good for you!
then , who is in the same class as , was reading his history text book and was becoming more and more elated as he read on.
define these three or four words.
do we want our society to be badly influenced by a bunch of profanity, violent slogans, or jargon?
also labraries can censor music.
in conclusion, computers can cause a bad influence due to viruses, too much time on it, and not doing other things.
computers usually make things worse.
not to fear super duper computer is here.
i chalenge you to name one thing you can do on the computer that you can't do without.
a lot of people that are in school have probably seen or heard of a book or magazine that had profanity or offended them.
this could save someone time and effort.
it amuses and excites.
when we go to for a vacation, i help my grandmother to water the plants.
to begin, computer can give you tips on things you didn't know, so it can also be a learning center.
a lot of people are not active because they on the computer harms on end.
past the time.
dear local newspaper, ... scroll... . ""
when my friends and i were learning about evaluating websites in computer processing class we came upon a site that seemed reliable, and accurate.
the people who have computer electric bill is always very high and for reason they are forced to pay or more dollars on electricity.
this is so offensive.
i believe gossip is one of the main reasons why most people buy magazines.
and how i think the years to come it will impact our lives bigger and better.
he was looking on what seemed like a very official site to purchase a big boat.
well with being able to just grab all the papers off line is easy.
infinite amounts of information can be found on your computer. ""
if it doesn't seem to violent/graphic for your child then allow them to watch the movie, read the book, or play the game.
its all on how you look at it you have to have a sense of humor when it comes to stuff like that.
if you don't have a phone, you use a computer to go on your email, or personal websites.
yes its true computers helps you learn things you not have known before, but so do books, newspapers and magazines.
also just cause one person tihnks its offensive doesn't mean that others will.
doctors, police officers, and banks use computers for thier job and it helps us go through are everyday lives with ease.
does that mean that the something should be censored just because it offends a couple of groups in a population?
of all the places, taking things off of the library shelves is not going to do justice of what really needs to be done
my final reason why computers have a negative effect on people is that people spend too much time on computers and don't exercise contribute about to overweight people.
going on picnics, taking long walks, reading useful books are good leisure time activities.
other people might enjoy that book.
i think it would bring us back a couple of ages.
first of all, the libraries will lose customers.
on many projects and homework assignments i have record kids say "" i just copied and printed an article on google.""
social was made to reconnect with friends far away, not across the street.
i heard music and learned some .
for example any book that involves nudity or lots of vilance.
first off, i'd like to mention the health issues associated with technology in general, but especally computers.
this has caused tension in relationships.
todays news is always with exciting events and horrible disaters that many people like to be updated with.
my last reason is why do people want to be on computers all day.
people go on every day uploading videos, pictures, blogs, and just about what ever they want.
though computers seem to abuse the privlage of communication.
so people do have a choice on what should be banned or not but they also have a choice on if they want to read it or not too.
they do not need to read about how guys rob places and are crimanals.
is this really what you want?
with computers we have enough for each kid in the class.
computer supply so much more then just entertainment.
kids use these as entertainment.
no matter where you are a compute can always be on available form of communication.
in the next paragraph i will talk about magazines.
some friends and family keep in touch completely by computer.
a great way to recieve oxygen is going outside for some exersize and energy.
all you have to do for that is go on the compute and look it up.
another reason why computers are a big help because you can stay in touch with friends and family.
computers bring no adventures, just pictures of them.
lets you keep in touch with everything thats going on with things like status updates.
they could think a word is bad when you think it's fine.
computers learning by let vast of information being available.
first family friends can communicate from a far distance.
the lack of exercise is increasing fast.
there are websites that have math games and school related things.
i remember when i was working on a project about .
all of these are reasons computers are helpful in educational proceeses, and should continue to be used.
i think that this difference between books and movies is a simple thing: books do not normally have an inappropriate cover, while bad movies often do.
because of bad effects the screen has on your eyes.
well, they do.
they can provide tons of information normally unobtainable.
have you listened closely?""
last years study has shown that of kids have improved hand movement faster than regular therpy.
the ticket came up to .
and have different books in different place's.
in other words, people spend too much time on the computer.
or your daughter from looking at porn.
some people want the books off the shelves some people don't.
if you can't keep kids from hearing or seeing anything offensive then why would you try and edit what they read in libraries.
you're never going to please everyone.
but the last thought a child would have is if the literature their reading is offensive or not.
such as, they are great for communication or up with some friends, also theirs an infinint amount of things to do.
also, children do a lot of school work on the computer.
it has become near that computers have become along part of peoples lives.
a student, who studies computer mechanics, quoted, "" help prevent brain damage by limiting the use of computers to only what needs to be done.
the doctors set up a computer equipped with video chat in the operating room and the soldier was, in a way, in two places at once.
dear , advances in technology and computers is a bad thing.
most of it has to be for some reason or another.
people live around offensivness every day on the street and in public places so censoring it in libraries would not protect anyone.
this is understandds because homework can be boring but it all pays off in the end.
anybody should know that your own opinion matters than anything else or anybody else.
obviously as a result there should be something done about this computer concern.
now dont you think computers can benefit anyone!
is time flying you by?
i remember making a with my best friend back when we were in grade.
that is why computers are needed.
that grade brought my adverage down form an a+ to an a-.
libraries have the freedom to get what ever books they want to and put them on shelves.
without the internet, probably half of the world communications would be down and that would not be good.
how do you think that author would feel?
there has even been a case of where a chid went mad and killed his/her parents in rage.
a hobby is the best form of recreation to mind and body.
example, can study their math facts online math or learn about the skeletal system health classes.
in addition if a student forgets, losses, or is missing homework, they can log on the school website and print the paper out.
in conclusion, you could see that computers benefit us in many ways.
there are children that know the words to alot of the rap songs out there.
another reason why i the exports are right about people and computers is to learn about nature and learn how to do things.
i personally think that compueters are a bad thing.
dear sun, i find that computers are very useful.
<@num1> of jobs relay on computers.
on another note a survey shows that of children that spend time with there family and less than minutes on the computer have grades higher than in all classes.
that way you get what you need done.
i feel the computers one or important aspect of our lives.
you can change the colors, font size, and font style on .
the can help a student pass school.
movies can help people learn about the real world by seeing how to do those type of things as we get older.
education is very important even for adults and children.
your body is special and your health is important.
nobody was trying to take away your music so why would you take away ours.
the last way that computers benefit society is it teaches people handeye coordination.
we are allowed to give our opinions on any topic, and describe it in any way.
dear, play a big role in our world today.
you be doing work or chatting with a friend, but your also just sitting their.
if books were to be taken of the shelves, we would only be depriving our youth of knowledge in the world.
therefore, i do and also don't agree that a library should be stripped of a book becuase it lacks intrest in someone or offend someone.
it has forty classrooms.
it helps my dad know when pappers and whos asking on what.
although some people say that using a computer cuts down your time for exercising and enjoying nature, but it really doesn't.
they also allow communication with foreign countries.
now, i can see how books are an excellent resource in society, and how they provide for amazing information, however it takes years to publish books!
now you can esily do so with video chat.
another example is if people read about someone doing drugs in a book, they want to try and experiment with drugs themselves.
now you can use this technology as a tool not a game.
but ig i couldn't use a computer then i would of had to use a book; instead of going on the computer and just looking it up.
i don't think anything over at a level.
honestly, if it's really that bad to you they won't remember it the next day.
another thing you could do is take online classes if you are having trouble in school.
there should just be a limitation on who can view it.
i recommend that everyone who wants an easier life should invest in a computer.
many historic moments in the world's history woul.d be lost forever.
many people enjoy their time on the computer because, with today's technology so many things can be done and quicker too.
it was the championship game.
for example, when you use a computer you dont need to look at your hands while you use the mouse.
it's just simply means everyone in this world is not the same.
people could also see animals, other people, the environments, and anything else they want to learn about.
communication, learning, and even shopping have become much simpler.
they can teach you things that most books cant, such as hand eye coordination also about the current populations of countrys and cities.
many agree, computers disadvantage many people in their own way.
same goes if a friend or you move away, but want to stay in touch.
although, being totally dependent on them is a bad idea to because they don't have that much benefit to them.
w are lucky that we live in a world with such a good teacher of hand-ey coordination.
if you do this thinks everyone will say that computer your positive effect and are one of the last invention created.
many people are too focused on the internet and they lack on their normal activities.
why i think we should have computers.
my last reason is, that people argue that people use it to learn about far away places and people, but they have books for that too.
over of population is obese and computers have been a major conributer.
some times people get locked because to much information was given out or you did somthing that you were'nt suppose to do.
also, it is keen that libraries divide up the different resources into separate sections for children, young adults, and adults.
you can chat with your friends, you have a webcam you can video chat with friends.
using a computer can save time and money when it comes to typing a paper.
.com is a bounty of information, serving up marsels of links for any-and every-topic.
most kids should go out side more for example my friend spent hours a day!
next, using computers builds hand eye coordination as well.
advertisement many be make-believe, but it has to stay.
if your a boy you could just go like a park and pay carrer base bill or even wrestle.
jobs will have more computers and touch screen devises because they are easier and more technologicly advanced.
i strongly believe computers do benefit society.
""the more people who see how beautiful is the less likely they will pollute it with smoke.
on computers, there are lots of games to play that are free.
questions such as these come to mind when the topic of censorship in libraries arises.
it really isn't good that people dont get of the computer and start enjoying life.
the shelves of libraries will soon be empty if censorship continues.
lastly, i think the computer has a negative effect because it them.
even a child interactions chatting with friends on or , anything could be said.
libraries are sometimes connotated as very boring.
some things are needed to look up or look at if one is doing a project.
if we're talking about my friends, family, my girlfriend, that's totally different.

this could be in more ways than one.

computers are everywhere you can find one at school, home, a cafe or even on your cell phone.
the computer also help you fine the history or book online so you can do your homework or project.
not all things online are like that though.
in conclusion, computers have a negiteve effect on people!

i for example have learned so much from.

i found myself next to a stinking man.
i would like to say their i think it does benef it our society.
i can easily just sit up in my room and be on the computer all the time.
kids learn alot of this through the media.
in conclusion, advances in technology will improve hand-eye coordination, teach people about far away places and people, and allows people to talk online with other people.
everyone has a right to read, listen, or watch what they want.
you can learn just about anything on the internet, and most of it is absolutely free.
not having these books up on the shelves, means no one can read them.
one day my mom took the computar ant threw it out the window and i had no chioce but to go outside and get some exersize.

now all of them excepent contry talk about drugs and talks about .
you can go on the internet and find out how they live there.
if you miss someone or you just want to talk there is websites that let you do that.
also something like in the , i don't think that it should be removed from shelve's just because of the title.
in addition, computers help you learn more about people, places and cultures.
parties, lunch breaks, or even a family dinner are great times to socialize.
if a book is removed from the library for its contents, people will look into as to why it was removed.
a word is simply a word.
to sum this all up i would like to tell you local news paper that you should agree that computers are a good thing for the society!
of people are under the age of without me advances of technology for cellphones this wouldn't even be possible for minors.
a lot of business people need it to work and last it is a good research engine.

for example let's say you are writing a paper on the computer that is due tomorrow.
this language is damaging how kids read and write.
schools practicaly live on computers.

my third reason is schools need computers for students and teachers to write reports, file the students name and grades into it.

computers are also great for typing out reports , making powerpoints for jobs and projects, and so much more!

maybe there parents should look at the books first or maybe they should have taken it off the shelf.
colour has been an inseparable part of man’s existence from times immemorial.

no parent wants their child coming home from school talking about sex, and drugs they saw in a book at school.
the last effect is talking to people that you don't know form online.
hand-eye coordination is a key part in our every day lives.
over all i think computers effect people in a positive way, and these are some reasons why.
i will now get into more detail on these three topics.
i believe that we can solve this problem by just seperating certain materials from others in the library.
teachers, students, parents, and grandparents learn everyday with computers.
my uncle took me to the station to board an electric train.
if that happened there would be an ongoing battle about it.
i know for a fact us teens watch funny movies to make our rough day turn into a better day , well that is what i do at least.
i personally, think libraries hold so many unique things that if somethings were offensive to people then i'd understand why everyone would want it to be removed.
what if kids get bad stuff off the shelf ?
now can you see how much the computer benefits society.
lastly, computers are a good way to socialize because of the range it can travel.
communicateing only over the computer can draw them away from people socially.
what ever happened to spending time with family and friends?
this benefits you because newspaper houses are organized by computers and it keeps you business running.
and don't forget get that they offer ways to chat online.
they help people, educate, and connect people.
i do not think that censorship is a good idea for any sort of material on a shelf.
a student in saw their grades improve from a + to a + just spending less time on the computer and more.
this is why the computer are good.
until, she got her hands on a computer.
our culture was loosing territory but as years past cultures and started to work together. ""
but sometimes we don't have to be on the computer so long.
what i'm trying to say is have censorship in the library, but at a very low standard.
you've been on the toilet of the day and alls youve got is your laptop.
'', the woman shreaked as she had just received a fierce, sharp,and quick stab in the back by her abusive husband.
freak and become highper when it comes to computers.
i think that computer can help you in that way the endless sites of information and of better.
these people roam through the internet day and night trying to find little boys and girls.
just because a book contains a few areas where innappropriate references are made doesn't mean that students shouldn't be able to read the book.
everyone is welcome in the library, of course, but is everyone aloud to look at whatever they want?
most websites give the ability for anyone to do so.
the mind is an extrordinary thing.
you can also enter chatrooms with people who share a common interest with you.
computers are one of the best technological advances the human race has made.
thus, the more vacations they go one which is profitable for airplane companies.
when i was little, my parents did a good job of censoring things that were bad for me to watch at that age.
step out of your door and you are faced with indiscipline.
computers have taken our socity in the next level.
also, nature becoming less and less of a priority with the computer in mind.
adults get offended to so would we take all of their resources away also including the newspaper.
my uncle went to ticketmaster.com and he ordered two tickets for wwe.
also, a of says that less people needed a loan when the computer came out with instant messaging and video chatting.
i use to search it all the time and i made a poster project for fun.
kids often get so caught up in playing these addictive games that they don't even think of playing sports or going outside.
need to go outside more and be active.
go out and have fun, dont let the keep you home.
however, noticing your kid being on the computer is not a good thing.
in fact, i have never seen a child in the adult section of a library.
whether the books relate well or poorly to each person is not something for a mass of people to decide.
people meet over the internet can be sometimes dangerous because some people lye about there age or put fake pictures of them.
many people use this device to book vacation, talk and build relationship people and to discover new ideas the world have to make the disagree strongly.
in , of course we have the freedom to do what we want.
ecspecially because they can talk to far away friends and whatever.
becuase there are many things that people take offensive, everyone is diffrent.
they asked him to make on thing after another.
hope you enjoy and understand my opinion on computers.
a major debate of today would be that of the media.
, undoubtedly many educational opportunities woulf be lost for your childred you were to stop using computers!
i think that people need to step away from the computer desk, get good grades, avoid bullying and criminals.
if you want to go on the computer to talk to your friends, it should be an insentive to get all your homework done first.
you could be outside having fun instead of sitting up in your house so get out!
in fact, many employers hire you based on your keyboarding skills, ones one is skilled enough they even teach themselves to type without looking at the keyboard.
their would be closer bonds with families if people stayed of the computer.
they can have different sections, such as adult, children, and young adult.
in conclusion, i do believe that this material should be taken off the shelves of public libraries.
everything shuld be in the library becuase their are different people and not everybody like the same things.
that is no excuse.
the book should not be put away, for there are also books that will be all about your beliefs.
many kids, not mostly boys, to what i see at school are absolutely loving online gaming.
educational benefits will only increase as technology, so cutting children from it now is a big mistake!
as each day goes by the minds of children become more and more cerious as to what the world has to offer.
so why not take the risk?
the solution to library censorship is the division of books into categories and sub-categories.
i have a few relative in , .
a kid walks into the library up town.
although some people believe that computers turn us children into zombies, i believe that they effect us in a posotive way.
i feel like when books or movies get or removed, it makes the author feel like they're worth nothing.
many people use computers for different reason.
they need to show respect for the books, movies, music, and magazines they provide for kids, teenagers, and parents.
going on the internet to learn new information is a great way to useing your souce.
some of them being across the ocean in .
i believe that almost of kid are on the computer because they have nothing to or it is addicting.
it also makes many people feel self consiou about themselves.
secondly, it's a form of communication.
most people would be offended and complain.
when negatively effecting all of these areas the consequences are much more influential then the benefits.
but some children can take some of this stuff the wrong way when they are reading a mature type book.
plus, computers begin to consume the rest of peoples' lives.
so enjoy it throug h a window next to your desk?
almost everyone has a computer and it gets used more and more and it is just taking away a great time to go be active outside.
nature used to be the most peaceful think now it the internet.
also online catalouges or advertisments help the economy of stores worldwide.
it can be as simple as riding a bike or taking your dog for a walk.
in my science class a boy named never does his homework.
a certain amount of time can be plugged in.
the reasone why i state this because those are the books that help you through out your life.
because you can get arthrits in your fingers.
my sisters are the inspiration for me to make the world in which we live a better place,well, my brother is too.
after that, they can not tell you to get off of it, unless you are violating the law or looking up something not age appropriate.
they agreed that if she were just a little older then she could of borrowed .
there's tons of games to play.
it takes less time, and you won't get carpal tunnel as easily.
i think people should spend more time living and less time with their faces glued to a computer screen!
you can find pictures and of faraway places and find out the currency or of a country.
all in all i believe that most books are based off of reality and other peoples visions on the world and what they see.
look up the weather, the celebrity gossip, and where the plance crashed that you mom told you about.
just because that single person doesn't like that certain thing doesn't mean they should take it away from everyone else.
you are on the computer for an hour and your family is having a barbeque.
not only that but you should notice the great potential the computer has for showing us distant, faraway lands and cultures.
dear newspaper, i think computers are great.
an :00pm my laptop has to be off on the weekends.
computer source found of in , and.
but computers are being used for other things.
the internet is the best way to contact those people.
so even taking away one book could make a kid learn one less thing.
so much information and so much faster.
because the computer is just words being texted.
which can only lead to a promotion!
communicating via computer is just another reason why the computer is so important.
i need to check my homework, research a topic, or use it for help.
i say this beacause not all your friends go to the same school so you dont see them as much.
that way when you get bored there is always something to do, instead of being home all day.
computer are good and bad because computers are good because that is a way we can comunicate with other people in different states.
so in conclusion, i think it should be reader and viewer discretion when it comes to content of things as this.
it makes viewing more interesting and exciting.
it helps people navagate through life, they can find jobs, do research for school.
i also think that computers do not have effect on people because through garde schoo, sometimes kids need the internet.
to be on the computer too much, your family will start to worry about you.
do you want any thing like that ever to happen to you or your family?
the rest room, toilets, parcel room and the canteen are few
, it lets my wife and i search details about a trip we want to go on.""
so you should really be consider judging the skills of the computer they really do help in life.
students would take advantage of this and they would have educational books removed.
sometimes getting angry she shouts us when we turn the house upside down.
censorship is a disgrace and should not be forced in libraries.
